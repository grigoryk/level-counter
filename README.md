Level Counter
=============

This project started when I started playing Munchkin with a group of friends. We needed a good way to track levels, and I created this. Oleksiy Khmelov helped out with the graphics.

Why meteorjs?
-------------

The platform seemed really neat from their online demo. I wanted to build something simple to try it out, and this project presented a good opportunity.

How buggy is it?
----------------

Somewhat. Not enough to annoy you while playing the game, but it lacks the exact amount of polish to annoy you while setting the game up.

On the other hand, this was written in couple of hours using something entirely new to me. By that measure, it's not so bad.

Tablets?
--------

Yes! This was created to run on my Blackberry Playbook. It works well on iPads as well (with very minor UI bugs that I need to iron out).

The idea is to have a tablet lying in the middle of the table for all to see the levels.
